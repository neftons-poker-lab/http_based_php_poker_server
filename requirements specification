1. Protocol. Http conection can not live a lot of time. So we must close connection after answer for client request.
So clients must periodicaly ask server for is there it`s turn to move?
1 time a second - think it is normal.

2. Store of current hand. File or database? Think second wil be more correct.

3. Store tournament history. Think the both option must be able.
Tournament history gets a lot of disk spase (Mb or even 10 or 100Mb) it will be hard and high price to store it on the server.
But we can store only some graphs of the toutnament. And will be able to temporaly download histori file to detiled analis.

4. Poker games. There are a lot of poker games and rules.
number of players, start chips, rake, blinds, ante, increase blinds in time, prise structure, etc.
Think it must be index page with choose what kind of tourney user wish to create. And then 
proper page will process clients requests.
